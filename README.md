# randomImage-lightbox
A lightbox built using vanilla JS, HTML, CSS. 

# API used
I used the https://randomuser.me/ API for generating random images to display on the webpage. 

# Issues 
Due to time constraints, I was not able to align the next/prev buttons properly with the modal. The prev/next buttons start becoming un-aligned on mobile devices with screen sizes smaller than 300x700px.

# update 
I actually broke the thing when I was tryna add webpacks to it. I will fix it in the future but right now I'm focussing on other projects.
